/*
Goal: Test of footage quality increase with manual input 
Precondition(s): Camera is already on and recording video at a lower quality
Action(s): increase video quality command sent to camera (via function in library)
Expected Behavior: Camera recording quality increases without pause in recording, and continues recording

Expected Behavior: //Button push or some other manual input should cause the filming quality to increase
camera should continue recording with no issues

    turn camera on, start recording

    when recieve input, increase the video quality
    call close down funtion that stops recording

//TC4 make test of decreasing 
/* 
Goal: Test that camera video quality can be decreased with no issues (currently there is no funtion written for this functionality)
Precondition(s): camera is on and footage is being recorded at a quality that is higher than the lowest possible. 
Action(s): reduce video quality command sent to camera (via a function in the library)
Expected Behavior:  camera footage decreases in quality when it recieves manual input and continues recording with no issues

//TC5 Make test of Stopping footage
/*
Goal: Test that footage can be stopped via commands
Precondition(s): Camera is recording (at any quality) and has sufficient battery life and space remaining for at lease a few minutes more 
Action(s): Send stop recording command to camera via function
Expected Behavior: Recording stops, and captured video is stored correctly and retrievable

/*
Goal: Test that camera footage can be restarted after being stopped by a user command
TCs covered:6
Precondition(s): Camera is recording footage
Action(s): Stop recording, (check after that video is saved correctly) restart recording via a command
Expected Behavior: Camera should start recording as usual with no issues
*/



//TC7 Have a very small/very full storage card in camera, and start recording and keep recording 
/*
Goal: Test that the camera can save video correctly when it runs out of space
TCs covered: 7
Precondition(s): Very full or very small SD card is used. Camera is running (at high quality to speed up the test)
Action(s): allow the camera to run until it is full
Expected Behavior: Camera should stop recording, and video should be saved successfully with no issues (be retrievable)
*/

//TC 8 have the batteries run out
/*
Goal: Test that the camera can save video correctly when it loses power
TCs covered: 8
Precondition(s): Camera is recording video as usual
Action(s): pull out batteries, or open the circuit in some other way to simulate losing power (DON'T RUN BATTERIES TO EMPTY- IT WILL DAMAGE THEM)
Expected Behavior: Camera should stop recording, and video shoudl be saved successfully with no issues (be retrievable)
*/

//TC8 have camera/accelerometer experience acceleration above the threshold value, and use that to trigger something in the camera





/*
Use cases: 

as a user, I want to be able to turn on the camera, and have it turn off after a set period of time

As  a user, I want to be able to turn on the camera and start recording right away, increase footage quality after some (non manual) input, then stop after a time limit 

As a user, I want the camera to safely turn off and stop recording when power is lost/batteries go low. 

As a user, I want footage to be successfully saved if the camera runs out of storage
