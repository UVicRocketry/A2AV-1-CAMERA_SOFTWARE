Use cases: 

as a user, I want to be able to turn on the camera, and have it turn off after a set period of time

As  a user, I want to be able to turn on the camera and start recording right away, increase footage quality after some (non manual) input, then stop after a time limit 

As a user, I want the camera to safely turn off and stop recording when power is lost/batteries go low.
